0|(Verse 1)\n In a world of rhythm, where the tracks entwine,\n A steam locomotive, a song in every line.\n Propelling itself, with a steamy embrace,\n Burning coal and oil, in a rhythmic chase.\n (Chorus)\n Oh, steam engine on wheels, a melody so grand,\n Expanding steam, like a magic band.\n Pistons dancing, connected to the ride,\n In this symphony of motion, on the steaming tide.\n (Verse 2)\n Fuel ablaze, in the boiler's fiery hold,\n Water and heat, in a tale untold.\n Cylinders sigh, as steam takes its chance,\n A locomotion waltz, in a rhythmic dance.\n (Bridge)\n Variations play in this locomotive song,\n Electric hums, as the turbines throng.\n Fuel and water, in a tender's embrace,\n As the wheels turn, leaving trails of grace.\n (Chorus)\n Oh, steam engine on wheels, a melody so grand,\n Expanding steam, like a magic band.\n Pistons dancing, connected to the ride,\n In this symphony of motion, on the steaming tide.\n (Verse 3)\n From each cylinder's end, steam takes flight,\n Linked to the wheels, a mechanical delight.\n In a tender's hold, supplies in tow,\n On the railroad journey, where stories grow.\n (Verse 4)\n Electric sparks fly, turbines in pride,\n Pistons replaced, in the locomotive stride.\n Externally generated, steam takes the lead,\n In the evolution of speed.\n (Chorus)\n Oh, steam engine on wheels, a melody so grand,\n Expanding steam, like a magic band.\n Pistons dancing, connected to the ride,\n In this symphony of motion, on the steaming tide.\n (Outro)\n In the twilight's gleam, as the wheels roll on,\n The locomotive's anthem, a timeless song.\n A melody of power, in history's gleam,\n In a world where everything's a song, a majestic dream.\n
